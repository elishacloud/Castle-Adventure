# Castle Adventure
### Introduction
This project is a remake of the old DOS Castle Adventure game written in 1984. You are trapped in a castle. You must find a way to get out while killing baddies and collecting goodies. The map is the same as the old game.

The code was written for [allegro.cc](https://www.allegro.cc/).  The code was written for DirectDraw v3 and DirectInput v3.  However, I am using [dxwrapper](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper) to convert this to Direct3D9 and DirectInput8.

I'm using this remake of the old game because this one most closely represents the old DOS game.
